### Instructions

This assignment will help you get practice with HTML and
some CSS as well.  Some HTML/CSS research might be required.

2. Modify `resume.html`
   so that it looks like [resume-target.png](resume-target.png).

   Refer to [resume-specifications.png](resume-specifications.png) for exact
   requirements.  Note that the entire content
   of the page should be a width of 960px, and that
   the page should be centered on your screen.

   HINT: You will need to research how to specify fonts in CSS, as well as how the `margin`
   property can be used to center an element
   on the screen.

   ANOTHER HINT: You only need to add CSS code inside the `<style>...</style>` element.  No other HTML
   changes should be necessary.
